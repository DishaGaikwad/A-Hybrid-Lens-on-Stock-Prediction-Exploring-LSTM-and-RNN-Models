# A-Hybrid-Lens-on-Stock-Prediction-Exploring-LSTM-and-RNN-Models
Developed a hybrid deep learning model combining LSTM and RNN to predict stock  prices with improved accuracy.  • Analyzed historical stock data and visualized trends for indices like NIFTY  FINSERV, IT, and METAL.  • Implemented the model using Python and evaluated performance using MSE and  RMSE metrics.
